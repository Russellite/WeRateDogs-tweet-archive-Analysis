# (Wrangle and Analyze Data (WeRateDogs tweet archive))

## Dataset

>This dataset that is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The WeRateDogs archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ tweets, but not everything. For the second dataset, a "url" to the file was provided. For the third dataset  a tweet-json.txt file was also on hand to get more information about the tweets.

## Summary of Wrangling Efforts

> During the wrangling phase, the datasets were assessed both visually and programmatically for data quality and tidiness issues and documented.

> The datasets were then cleaned based on the issues identified, and then merged into one table. Finally, the dataset was now stored into one master dataset.


## Key Insights explored

> For this presentation, I will focus on answering some questions like, what is the most popular dog breed and rating? what is the most popular dog name? what is most source of tweets? What is the most occurring dog stage?
